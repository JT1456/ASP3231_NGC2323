# ASP3231_NGC2323

In this report, we investigate the properties of the open cluster NGC 2323 using images taken using
the Hutton-Westfold Observatory (C14). By converting photon counts to an apparent magnitude and
then absolute magnitude using age-luminosity isochrones, we calculated the distance to the open
cluster, allowing us to use the mass relation to calculate the initial mass function of the cluster. We
determined the age of the cluster to be 150 Myr ± 10 Myr and the distance to be 954 pc ± 40 pc. The
age value corresponds nicely with the literature value of 140 Myr (Frolov, Ananjevskaja and Polyakov
2012). There was a larger difference when it came to the distance calculation, which had a literature
value of 902pc (Dib, Schmeja & Parker 2018).
